            Hi, I'm Bryan. I'm a rising senior at Northwestern University
            studying computer science and political science. I have a strong
            passion for utilizing my knowledge of computer science to create
            policy and law relevant to the increasing intersection of
            technology and society. I believe technology has the power to
            better our world, if used ethically and responsibly. I have
            experience in full-stack web development, data analysis, and
            machine learning. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to
            think critically and creatively.
